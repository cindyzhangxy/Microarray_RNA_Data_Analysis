*Motivation* 
Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is escalating to be an epidemic problem in many parts of the world $^1$ . Weight reduction for obese patients has been given as a routine advise from health care professionals. BMI >30 is the most common definition for obesity. However, does BMI affect T2D at a genetic level? That is, does BMI >30 change gene differential expression in patients with T2D vs. healthy individual?  

This project attempts to elucidate the effect of BMI on differential gene expression in T2D. 

*Data Summary*

The dataset has been previously described by [Mahdi et al. , 2012]( https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(12)00409-3?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1550413112004093%3Fshowall%3Dtrue) where the authors explroe the pathophysiology of T2D by analyzing the gene coexpression to investigate if their pre-defined module is associated with T2D, elevated HbA1C and reduced insulin secretion. They performed PCA to identify these eignegenes and perform a gene set enrichment in answering their biological questions. In [Tang et al. , 2014](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.3009934?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed), the authors performed an additive linear regression with covariates: age, sex and BMI to investigate the association betwewen yohimbine dosage and insulin secretion in 30 minutes.
